# Palindrome-Calendar
 identifies palindrome dates in the 21st century (2001-2100) and writes them to a file
This Python script identifies palindrome dates in the 21st century (2001-2100) and writes them to a file. A palindrome date reads the same backward as forward in the DD/MM/YYYY format. The script follows these steps:

Check Palindrome: Defines a function is_palindrome(s) to check if a given string s is a palindrome.

Generate Palindrome Dates: The generate_palindrome_dates() function iterates through each year from 2001 to 2100, each month (1-12), and each day (1-31) as applicable, considering the varying lengths of months and leap years. It formats dates as DD/MM/YYYY, checks for palindrome dates without the slashes, and collects them.

Write to File: The identified palindrome dates are written to palindrome_dates.txt, each on a new line.

Completion Notification: Prints the file path where the palindrome dates are saved, indicating the operation's completion.

This efficient script automates the process of finding and recording palindrome dates, providing a useful resource for applications or analyses involving unique calendar dates.
